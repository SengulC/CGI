## Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) Coursework

This is the repository for my CGI coursework where in...
- cgi report.pdf you can find a report outlining my modelling and animating process
- /images you can find a gallery of screenshots of my model, and below the animated video.
- Note: the Maya files are unavailable on this repository as the files are too large.

** ALL OBJECTS IN THE SCENE WERE MODELLED BY ME. Only 3rd party content are the textures.
